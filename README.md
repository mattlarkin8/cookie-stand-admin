## Author: Matthew Larkin

## About This Page

This web page is the foundation for learning to use Next.js and use Tailwind for styling. It allows the user to add a location for a new cookie stand with all the info for that new location. This is a continuation of the salmon cookies lab from our 201 course. We will continue to build on the functionality of this page throughout the next few labs.
